# Phaser Playable Ad Template

This is a boilerplate project I created to streamline development of interactive **playable mobile ads**, the kind I designed while working at **AppLovin**. Each ad follows a standardized, proven flow built for performance, clarity, and user engagement within a short, tappable experience.

## üß† Why This Exists

Playable ads require fast iteration and strong structure ‚Äî so I built this template to:
- üí° **Speed up** the process of prototyping new ideas
- üîÅ **Enforce consistent architecture** across projects
- üß± Provide a **solid foundation** of UI flow and game scaffolding
- üß™ Showcase how I transform this boilerplate into engaging, interactive playables

## üéÆ Structure and Flow

Each project built from this template follows a typical playable ad flow:

1. **UI Scene** ‚Äì splash visuals, CTA, start button
2. **Game Scene** ‚Äì short, engaging mechanic or tap-based interaction
3. **Win/Lose Modal** ‚Äì feedback and progression
4. **Return Modal** ‚Äì shown after user returns from the App Store

These stages are easily swappable and extendable with your own assets and ideas.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Phaser 3** (modernized ‚Äì this template uses the latest versions, unlike the deprecated setup I previously worked with)
- **React** ‚Äì used as the container layer for asset delivery and integration
- **JavaScript** throughout

## üì£ A Note to Reviewers and Hiring Managers

If you‚Äôre reviewing this as part of my portfolio:  
üîç This repo is **not a finished product** ‚Äî it‚Äôs the reusable starting point from which I build short-form interactive ads.

üëâ Please check out some of my other public projects to see **fully built playables** derived from this template.  
This boilerplate serves to demonstrate how I organize projects, set up pipelines, and think through scalable ad production workflows.

## üì± Mobile-First Focus

- The root container is automatically resized to simulate a **mobile screen ratio**, emulating typical playable ad dimensions
- Future versions may support **device rotation**

---

## üöÄ How I Use This

Whenever I begin a new ad concept:
1. I copy this template
2. Swap out placeholder assets
3. Flesh out the flow (entry > game > feedback > return)
4. Add the core gameplay mechanic last

This consistent pipeline allows me to test more ideas faster while maintaining a clean UX and codebase.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Setup Instructions Coming Soon

I'll be adding a quick start section with instructions on how to run a project based on this template.
